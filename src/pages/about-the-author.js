                                        Back when I had just become a teenager, my dad gave me
                                        his old family Victrola complete with some old records
                                        from his family in Virginia. Some of these old records
                                        were gospels songs of famous quartets like "The Carter Family,"
                                        "The Chuck Wagon Gang," and "The Smokey Mountain 
                                        Boys." Of course, that type of music was different from 
                                        what we heard over the radio back then and even now.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I grew up in a typical middle-class neighborhood on
                                        Mulberry Street in Daytona Beach, Florida. Mulberry Street is
                                        on the mainland side of town, east of US 1, west 
                                        of Beach Street, and the part we lived on was south of
                                        Madison Avenue.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        My family never went to church, so neither did I.
                                        Therefore, I grew up an American pagan. But one day I
                                        stopped by a church in our neighborhood. These church
                                        people were singing old-fashioned gospel songs just like I
                                        heard from that old Victrola my dad gave me. This church
                                        was of a holiness denomination called the First Church of the
                                        Nazarene. They had a song leader who was a very big man.
                                        He was both very tall and very heavy; he must have weighed
                                        over four hundred pounds, and he had abooming voice
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Sometimes I would stop by that church when they were
                                        singing.The song leader, that bigman, would tell them the
                                        page number of the song and hum the key so that the congregation could start to sing. But once he started singing
                                        too, no one could hear anyone else but him. His voice carried up and down the street and even across the street. His
                                        singing somehow made me shake; I liked the feeling even
                                        though I did not fully understand it all back then. Folks in
                                        the neighborhood said that he was an anointed singer set
                                        apart by God with the gift of praise. Others said that he
                                        was the only truly sanctified man whom they had everseen.
                                        In any case, this was the first time I ever felt God. No one
                                        had ever told me that it was even possible to feel God. So
                                        I must have had that old “hard shell, hog and hominy”
                                        Cessationist belief drilled into me; that any religious experience or relationship with God was based on rules, regulations, and laws of scripture and not any feelings atall.

                                    <p>
                                        Around the same time, a TV program came on theair
                                        each week called The Happy Goodmans. They sang the same
                                        old gospel tunes that that church sang, so I thought that
                                        that same feeling like exhilaration with shaking might happen again as the wife of the evangelist Vestal Goodman also
                                        sang with an anointed voice. By this time, I had learned
                                        by experience that the anointing on others somehowmade
                                        me shake. One day they described how this anointing had
                                        come onVestal.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Vestal Goodman and her husband, Howard, were
                                        holding revivals in a small town in Louisiana. A bad hurricane had come through, tore the tent and things up, and
                                        rained all over the electrical equipment so that they had
                                        no working microphone. Vestal got up to sing anyway
                                        by faith with her soft soprano voice. Just then the Holy 
                                        Spirit came upon her and her voice boomed throughout
                                        that tattered tent; everyone heard her. Her shocked family was astonished and asked what had happened. An old
                                        woman said that the Spirit of God had just anointed her
                                        with power to sing.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Since that day, the fame of this woman and her
                                        voice has gone throughout the land and even onto television, which was just black and white back in those days.
                                        Although I was still not yet a born-again Christian, nevertheless I watched that show religiously every week because
                                        it made me feel good, and I got to shake just like a “holy
                                        roller,” even though I was just an unsaved street kid.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        About that same time, a Baptist evangelist who drove a
                                        new Cadillac car put up a big tent to hold revival in Holly
                                        Hill, Florida, the town next door. I remember that his tent
                                        was put up in a swampy area, which is now filled in and has
                                        luxury homes built there. I guess those people living there
                                        would be horrified to know that their expensive homes
                                        were built on filled-in swamp.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        These Baptist people sang those same gospel tunes,but
                                        without any feeling in them. Nevertheless, I went forward
                                        to get saved anyway since I wanted to get closer to God in
                                        order to shake. But since there was no feeling in that experience and I never shook there, it did not last.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        It lasted a little while though, and I even got adopted
                                        by a well-to-do childless couple named O’Brien who took
                                        me to every Sunday service at White Chapel Church of
                                        God, where I was baptized in water in 1961. But since
                                        there was no feeling there, in time I fell away into naughtiness, common to the street life I grew up in. Gradually, my
                                        bad behavior sank into open sin. In time I was convicted
                                        of forgery and sent away to serve a couple of years in the
                                        Florida State Prison. But then my second chance to experience God and shake “big time” began right in that prison.
                                        This was really weird but before I share it, let me describe
                                        my prison experience first. At first, I was somewhat apprehensive because I was a good-looking former surfer with
                                        blond hair. Back then, I was already a highschool graduate with some college and could type, therefore the classification supervisor of the Florida prison system had me
                                        become his new clerk.This was a trusted position complete with a white uniform and a pass to go anywhere in
                                        the prison without having to be guarded.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        My prison job involved my assembling of all important
                                        papers on each new inmate for the classification committee. Only free people, employees of the state of Florida get
                                        to do that same kind of work now. But back in those days,
                                        I got to do it all. These papers I had to acquire and assemble included official court commitment papers with any
                                        presentence investigation reports or probation and parole
                                        papers, psychological reports made by the prison psychologist including IQ tests, social reports of the classification
                                        officer, chaplain’s report, and custody recommendation.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Working with these papers required personal trust. I
                                        was not allowed to disclose whatever I saw. I remember one
                                        strange case that appalled me back then and still troubles
                                        me some as I wonder how a person created in the imageof
                                        God could possibly do such an evil act. I’m talking about
                                        a young Black man who told everyone that he got twenty
                                        years for robbery when the court commitment papers 
                                        showed that he had sexually assaulted an infant by sticking his finger into her. If I had ventured to set the record
                                        straight, that guy’s life would have been forfeit and I did
                                        not want his blood on my hands, so I kept my mouth shut.
                                        Otherwise, this prison job was just like any other nine-tofive office job. Only we also had to work sometimes on
                                        weekends like Saturday or Sunday because the classification committee which met every week had to have their
                                        papers ready for them so they could decide which rehabilitation program to put each new inmate in, and which
                                        custody or correctional institution to send them to.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        A few months after I arrived, it was already time for
                                        Easter. Since I had been a surfer on the outside, I was used
                                        to getting up early. So I went to Easter Sunrise Service,
                                        which was one of my trusty privileges. Since this was the
                                        only day of the year when we could get out of our cells
                                        early in the morning, many trustees came from all over the
                                        prison not only for the Easter service but also toremember
                                        what early mornings with sunrise was like.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Once we filled up the bleachers set up in the prison
                                        yard, the Chaplain prayed. Down in front was a visiting
                                        prison chain gang dressed in prison blues. I thought that
                                        they had come to worship with us too. Instead one oftheir
                                        guards set down his rifle and introduced one of them to
                                        singforus.This singer was a young Black man who started
                                        to sing the old Negro Spiritual about “Sometimes It Causes
                                        Me to Tremble.”At once I recognized that this man had
                                        a professional voice, since I had studied voice in college
                                        and knew that his voice had a three-octave range. In other
                                        words, he could hit any note in music both low notes and
                                        high ones too. So I wondered why a guy with such a fabulous voice, better than anyone I had ever heard, was in
                                        prison with the rest of us, just cutting grass on the side of
                                        some road every day. Then my mind moved from being
                                        centered on his voice to the words of the song he sang for
                                        us. As he finished singing the first verse, he went on to sing
                                        the chorus about “Sometimes It Causes Me to Tremble,” and
                                        I started to shake again just as I had done as a kid.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This time my shaking was “big time.” As it would
                                        not stop. One of my friends gave me my prison jacket,
                                        but I still shook since I really wasn’t cold. Usually I had
                                        learned by experience that my shaking accompanied someone’s anointing, and when their anointing was over, my
                                        shaking ended too. But this time I shook after that Black
                                        man finished singing, and for the rest of that Easter Sunrise
                                        Service, I shook on the way back to our cells too. Once
                                        we arrived, I still shook. I even shook for count time that
                                        morning. When I went to eat breakfast, I still shook. It’s
                                        hard to eat when you’re shaking, but somehow I managed
                                        to eat my oatmeal.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Afterward, since it was a holiday and I did not have
                                        to work, I r`eturned to my housing area and laid down to
                                        take a nap. But I could not go to sleep as I still shook. By
                                        this time, my shaking had gone from just my usual feeling
                                        good about my shaking to concern and even alarm for my
                                        well-being.`
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Then it came lunchtime. We all lined up to go to lunch.
                                        I still shook, but I was determined to eat this goodholiday
                                        meal anyway. The lunchroom people had prepared Black
                                        Angus steaks from the prison farm fo rus. These steaks were
                                        big, juicy, and filled the whole plate, so big that our vegetables had to be put on top of our steaks. Actually, all this
                                        food was both very fresh and very good back in those days.
                                        Eating good was seen to be a basic human right, even for
                                        prison inmates back then. So the steaks were real, without soy fillers. The state of Florida had a huge Division of
                                        Corrections farm and ranch in Belle Glade, Florida, from
                                        whence our food came. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        As we sat down to eat, people avoided sitting by me as
                                        if I were contaminated with some sickness that they were
                                        afraid to catch since I still shook, but I managed to eat my
                                        steak anyway.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        After eating, our group of inmates returned to our
                                        dorm to watch TV sports. But I laid down to take an afternoon nap. Since I was still shaking, I could not go to sleep.
                                        So after a few hours of self-imposed rest, I got up to get
                                        ready for supper
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        At supper, I sat at a corner table by myself since I was
                                        still shaking. As the other guys came in, they sat together at
                                        the main tables in the center. I don’t remember what we ate
                                        for that meal, but I’m sure it must have been good. After
                                        we ate, we returned to the dorm where most of us watched
                                        the TV news. I saw the TV news too, then some wrestling
                                        program. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Suddenly count time crept up on us. We all stood by
                                        our beds as the prison guard would call out our last names
                                        and we responded with our prison number. When he got
                                        to me, he called my last name, Starnes, and I responded,
                                        “020, 563.” You never forget your prison number. Then
                                        before moving on to the next bed, he asked me if I was 
                                        still shaking. I said, “Yes, sir.” You can’t hide your personal
                                        problems from the guards since it’s their job to stay fully
                                        informed about those they’re guarding. Then he took out
                                        a pad of papers and wrote me out a sick pass and told
                                        me, “If you’re still shaking in the morning, be sure you
                                        make sick call. There’s a bad flu going around that’s killing people and we don’t want you to cheat Florida out of
                                        its time.” I said, “Yes, sir,” then he moved on. I thought
                                        later that his statement to me was rather cold. But I had
                                        learned by this time to always treat prison guards with
                                        respect and common courtesy. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        After count time was over, we all got into our beds.
                                        Then the guard turned off our light. I tried to go to sleep,
                                        but my shaking wouldn’t quit. Eventually my shaking
                                        seemed to subside enough for me to go to sleep. So I slept
                                        well that night. The next morning, as I woke up, I noticed
                                        that my shaking was gone. Of course, this all was a mystery
                                        to me back then. So I just put it out of my mind and went
                                        on doing whatever I had to face thatday.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I did wonder a few times about the gospel singer at
                                        that Easter Sunrise Service if I’d ever hear his voice again.
                                        It’s now been over fifty years, and I wonder whatever happened to that guy.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Once I had to go over to the photographer to retrieve
                                        some ID pictures for the Classification Committee. While
                                        there, I saw the prison photographer taking ID photos of
                                        a death row inmate. Because this guy was about my same
                                        age back then and I saw on his court commitment papers
                                        the word DEATH in capital letters. So I could not look at
                                        the guy as a cold feeling would come over me. Just then,
                                        the devil seemed to say that this is what happened to that
                                        singer. But I knew better as death row inmates stay on death
                                        row, they do not work on chain gangs nor go out tosing.

                                    <p>
                                        My life was rather uneventful and went on normally
                                        from that day. A few months later, I received an official letter from the Florida Probation and Parole Commission in
                                        Tallahassee, Florida. They told me what they were going to
                                        do and what would be happening to me. They also ordered
                                        my classification boss to have me transferred to minimum
                                        security at the Avon Park Correctional Institution in Avon
                                        Park, Florida, in preparation for my release. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        They said that my family had moved to California and
                                        had even found me a job out there. So they were going to
                                        give me an interstate parole, which was rare back in those
                                        days. First they would send me to Avon Park Correctional
                                        Institution for a few months of minimum custody. Then
                                        I would be released on parole to California. I was to be
                                        given bus fair to Tampa, Florida, then fly nonstop to LA.
                                        There I would meet my folks and go to work that week.
                                        The next week I was to report to my California parole
                                        officer who would meet me at home so he could check out
                                        my living arrangements, meet my folks, and interview me
                                        there in person.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        When I left the Florida state prison and arrived at Avon
                                        Park Correctional Institution, the first thing I noticed was
                                        the quality of the food. It seemed to me that good food
                                        was used to pacify those hoodlums, thugs, and lowlifes at
                                        the main prison, but not wasted on the older career criminals and white-collar criminals of Avon Park Correctional
                                        Institution. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I thought that my job skills at the main prison would
                                        ease me into some type of office job. But in prison, you
                                        don’t get to choose what you want. Back then, they needed
                                        another tailor to work with the sewing machine. Of course,
                                        I knew nothing about sewing, but I learned quickly. This
                                        correctional institution was much different from what I
                                        had become used to. There were less Black inmates there
                                        and much older inmates. This correctional institution also
                                        included the prison hospital, so there were some amputees
                                        and some in wheelchairs too.
                                    </p>

                                        Usually I keep to myself, but there a middle-aged Jewish
                                        inmate from South Florida became my friend. He was a
                                        very sarcastic New York Jew and conman with an unusual
                                        ability to read people like books. One day I showed him
                                        my letter from the parole board. After he read it, he unexpectedly broke down and told me that these people were
                                        giving me a second chance and I should feel very blessed to
                                        be given a brand-new life. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        After serving a few months there, it was time for my
                                        release—everything happened just as the parole board had
                                        authorized. First I was dismissed from my prison job, then
                                        sent back to my dorm to put my few personal things and
                                        papers into a plastic bag. They ordered me to strip mybed
                                        and take my sheets and blanket to the laundry room. After
                                        I turned in my bedding there, I was ordered to take off my
                                        prison clothes. I was then given street clothes, a new suit
                                        and black shoes. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        After I changed into the new street clothes and returned
                                        my old prison clothes, I boarded their prison bus bound
                                        for the local Greyhound bus station. There I gave them
                                        my ticket to Tampa, Florida. Once I arrived in Tampa, I
                                        went to their airport there and gave them my direct nonstop ticket for a flight to LA. (Even though I was an ex-offender on parole, there was no TSA in those days with all
                                        their bureaucratic searching of you and your baggage to
                                        prevent terrorism. See how much freedom we have lost. )
                                        After I boarded the plane, I strapped myself in. The plane
                                        trip only took a few hours and since we crossed several time
                                        zones, it was still morning when I arrived in LA. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        After the plane landed, I headed for the noisy terminal
                                        to meet my folks. When I stepped into that big terminal
                                        in LA, California, it was like a whole new world. I had
                                        landed right into the Jesus Movement Revival complete
                                        with deliverances, healings, and other Pentecostal manifestations of God’s grace. Of course, I was very surprised to
                                        see with my own eyes the book of Acts coming back to life
                                        right in a public place, not a church. All sorts of ministry
                                        and other things were happening there. People were praying, crying, hollering, shouting, talking, and even singing.
                                        Deliverances were happening and hands were being laid on
                                        some with miracle manifestations. Anyway, there was just
                                        pandemonium there. My folks saw me, and my mother got
                                        me out of there with my bag of stuff. But before we left,
                                        I saw one of those Jesus people by the door handing out
                                        cards to their church and I grabbed one and stuck it in with
                                        my other personal papers and stuff
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Once I got home and unwound some and went through
                                        some debriefing, I asked about these Jesus people. I was
                                        told that these people were very famous and were even on
                                        the TV news because of all the genuine stuff that they were
                                        doing and the truth that they lived as a major contrast to all
                                        thepolitical lies about the Vietnam War. These people were
                                        mainly ex-dopers whom God had forgiven and anointed to
                                        speak and do what politicians should be saying and doing.
                                        Anyway, it was an “out of sight” scene. That night I was
                                        glad to take my first bath at home. The next morning, I got
                                        up early as usual to get ready to go to my newjob.

                                        My work site was a small machine shop in another
                                        town that I had to drive to. (My mother let me use her
                                        new car). I was very careful driving, but it was hard after a
                                        couple of years of not driving at all. In other words, I was
                                        out of practice. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Once I got there and met my new boss, he told me that
                                        my new job involved me having to stand all day drilling
                                        parts for airplanes that had to be exact. I was used tooffice
                                        work, then sewing. I had never worked in a machine shop
                                        before. I was required to stand all day in front of a drill
                                        press and pull it down to make my little metal hole that
                                        this part needed. This was very exacting work and required
                                        occasional inspection by the owner to see that each part I
                                        did met its specifications. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The owner of the shop stayed with me that first day to
                                        insure that I did things right. His son also worked in the shop
                                        with several other men. The job was a good job and paid
                                        well. After working there that first day, I drove home to eat
                                        my spaghetti dinner. (My mother is Italian and a good cook.)
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        After we ate, we watched some TV news, where we saw
                                        the Jesus people again at the airport. Then I helped my sister do her homework and went to bed. The nextday I went
                                        to work again and settled into a daily routine.
